<h2><a name="A_MARVEL_OF_ARTISTIC_GENIUS" id="A_MARVEL_OF_ARTISTIC_GENIUS">A MARVEL OF ARTISTIC GENIUS.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Coggeshall</span> in Essex is a small market-town,
which, in days past was of some slight importance
as a busy little manufacturing place, but which of
later years has been drained of population, like
many another place, to supply material for the
great 'centres.' It now has little to boast of but
its fine church, one of the three finest in the
county, and some most interesting ruins, well
known to antiquaries; it takes, however, a great
pride in owning the parentage of the subject of
this notice.</p>

<p>John Carter was the only son of a respectable
labourer in Coggeshall, but was himself brought up
to silk-weaving, that being the staple trade of the
town. He was educated in the usual way at the
national school; but at the age of thirteen was
transferred to Sir R. Hitcham's grammar-school,
where he continued about two years. During this
period he was chiefly remarkable for his aptitude
for getting into mischief; and the only sign given
of the latent talent which was afterwards so
strangely developed in him was in drawing horses
and dogs of questionable beauty on his slates and
copy-books; the walls of his cottage also were frequently
put under requisition for the same purpose;
a mark of talent which his mother in those
days could have readily dispensed with, as not
tending to improve the look of her humble apartment,
which she always kept most scrupulously
neat and clean. He was a bright intelligent boy,
and this and his high spirits made him a general
favourite, but proved also a great snare to him. He
became acquainted with a set of wild young men,
and soon, naturally enough, became the ringleader
in all sorts of daring enterprise.</p>

<p>When Carter was about twenty he married; but
though his wife was a quiet and respectable young
woman, his marriage does not appear to have
steadied him. He and his wild companions used
to meet at one of the public-houses and there
talk over and arrange their operations. One of the
projects which these choice spirits agreed upon
was a rooking expedition, the young rooks being
then in season. It was in the month of May 1836.
The place agreed on was Holfield Grange, there
being there a fine old avenue of elms, in which
the rooks from time immemorial had comfortably
settled. The avenue was disused; and as it was
some little way from the house and away from the
road and preserves, there was little chance of their
being interrupted by watchmen or gamekeepers.
They arranged to meet in a field outside the town
with a given signal, by which they might know
friend from foe; this was to avoid leaving the town
in a body, which might have suggested suspicions
of mischief, and induced a little watching. Midnight
found them all at the rendezvous, and little
more than half an hour's walking brought them
to the chosen spot. Carter, foremost as usual,
was the first to climb one of the tall trees, and was
soon busy enough securing the young birds. The
trees in the avenue are very old, and stand somewhat
close together, their gnarled and massive
boughs frequently interlacing, making it quite
possible for an expert climber to pass from one
tree to another. In attempting to perform this,
Carter deceived either in the distance or strength
of a bough, missed his hold and fell to the ground,
a distance of about forty feet. He had fallen
apparently on his head, for it was crushed forwards
on to his chest. For a time he lay perfectly
senseless, and the dismay of his wretched companions
may be imagined. Their position was an
unenviable one, to say the least. What were they
to do? A mile and a half from the town, in the
dead of night, in the midst of their depredations,
which must now inevitably become known, and
with one of their party dying or dead, they knew
not which.</p>

<p>After a time, Carter seems to have recovered
consciousness partially, and made them understand,
though his speech was so much affected as to be
almost unintelligible, that he wanted them to 'pull
him out!' This rough surgery they therefore
tried, some taking his head and some his feet, and
pulled till he could once more speak plainly; and
having done that, seemed to think that there was
nothing more they could do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">{242}</a></span></p>

<p>Would one or two more judicious tugs have
fitted the dislocated bones together again, or
would they have broken the spinal marrow? Who
can tell? In either case the world would have
lost one striking case of latent talent developed
by a misfortune which seemed indeed only one
remove from death; so we will not complain.</p>

<p>Finding that no further improvement took place
in the poor fellow, and that he had lapsed into
unconsciousness, his companions procured a hurdle,
and laying him on it with all the skill and gentleness
of which they were capable, retraced their
steps to the town, and bore him to the home which
he had left a few hours before in the full strength
and health of early manhood. They laid him on
his bed and then slunk away, glad to shut out
from their sight the terrible result of their headlong
folly, one only remaining to tell to the poor
wife the sad story of the disaster. The doctor
was sent for; and the result of his examination
was the terrible verdict that Carter had not in all
probability many days or even hours to live; in
any case, whether he lived or not, he was paralysed
without hope of recovery.</p>

<p>He did not recover consciousness entirely till
the following night; and we who have the full
enjoyment of our limbs and health can hardly
realise what that poor fellow must have suffered in
learning that, even if life were granted to him at
all, it was under such terrible conditions as at first
to seem to him less a boon than a burden. He
would never again be able to move hand or foot,
the only power of movement remaining to him
being in the neck, which just enabled him to
raise or turn round his head; that was <i>all</i>&mdash;there
was not even feeling in the rest of his body.
What a dreary blank in the future! What wonder
if the undisciplined soul cried out aloud with
repining, like a wild bird beating against the bars
of a cage; what wonder if in the bitterness of
his heart he cried: 'Of what good is my life to
me! Better that I had never been born, since all
that makes life sweet is taken from me.'</p>

<p>Anguish unknown, terrors too great for words,
must that poor soul have met and overcome, ere
he had learned the great lesson of sorrow, that life,
true life, does not consist in mere physical capabilities
and enjoyments, but that there is a far higher,
nobler life, the life of the soul and mind, which
is as infinitely above the other as heaven is above
earth. His mind being now no longer overridden
by his superabundant physical nature, began to
work and put forth its powers and energies; but
it was long ere he found any object on which to
expend those powers; not till he had, through
several long and heavy years of suffering, learned
the great and most difficult lesson of patience&mdash;patience,
without which he would never have
accomplished the wonderful work which we will
now proceed to describe.</p>

<p>Having read one day of some young woman
who, deprived of the use of her hands, had learned
to draw little things with her <i>mouth</i>, he was
seized with a desire to try the same thing, and was
not content till he had made his first attempt.
Deprived of the use of his hands, why not try his
mouth! A butterfly that had fluttered into the
cottage was caught and transfixed; a rough desk
extemporised, and with such materials as a sixpenny
box of paints afforded, he made a sketch of
the insect. Delighted with his success, he determined
to persevere. A light deal desk was made
after his own directions, on which to fix his paper;
the picture he was about to copy being fastened
above, or if large, hung from the top of the bed
by tapes; he always drew in bed, his head being
slightly raised by pillows. A pencil about six
inches long and bound round with thread was put
in his mouth, and with this he sketched his subject.
A saucer of Indian ink was prepared, and a fine
camel-hair brush was dipped and placed in his
mouth by the attendant; these brushes were
sometimes not more than four inches long. In
this way he produced the most exquisite drawings,
equal to fine line engravings, which were
sold for him by his friends and patrons, some
of them finding their way into the highest
quarters; and thus he was enabled to experience
the delight of feeling that paralysed as he was,
he was not a mere burden, but was able to contribute
to his own support.</p>

<p>Several of the most beautiful of his works are
now in America, and we believe we are right in
saying that as much as twenty-five and fifty
pounds apiece have been given for them. Another
very fine work, a copy of 'St John and the Angel,'
about eighteen inches by twelve, is in the possession
of Robert Hanbury, Esq., of Poles Ware,
Hertfordshire, and is wonderful in its power and
delicacy. In the copies from Rembrandt, Carter
has so completely caught the peculiar touch and
style of the great master, that even a connoisseur
would have some difficulty in distinguishing them
from the original.</p>

<p>Carter tried various styles&mdash;water-colour, chalks,
mezzotint, and line drawing; but it was the last in
which he succeeded best, and which best displayed
his great delicacy of touch. The chalks required
too great pressure, and fatigued him so much that
he was only able to finish two or three pictures in
this style, a masterly head of St Peter being one;
but the grand sweep of the unbroken lines in
these shews, we think, his talent more than any of
his works.</p>

<p>He found many kind friends who interested
themselves in his work, and supplied him with
subjects to copy; notably amongst these, Miss
Hanbury of Holfield Grange, now wife of the Dean
of Winchester. Mr Richmond the artist also came
to see him on several occasions, and speaks of him
thus in a letter: 'The first time I saw him [Carter]
I was taken to his cottage by the Rev. Charles
Forster, vicar of Stisted, Essex; and the impression
of that visit I shall never lose, for the contrast of
the utterly helpless body of the man with the
bright and beaming expression of his face, which
only a peaceful and clear spirit could raise, was a
sight to do one good. It was as it were "the face
of an angel," and I always think of him in connection
with that passage.' This latter remark is no
exaggeration, for Carter was more than ordinarily
handsome, of that old Roman type so common
amongst the agricultural labourers in Essex, which
ill-health and suffering had only improved by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">{243}</a></span>
adding refinement to his well-cut features; and
the expression of deep humility and patience
was most touching in its earnestness. Richmond,
speaking elsewhere of his works, says: 'His power
of imitation was extraordinary&mdash;I mean it would
have been extraordinary in one possessing hands to
execute his thought with; but to see him with
his short pencil between his lips executing with
the greatest precision and skill intricate forms
and describing difficult curves, filled me with
wonder and admiration.'<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Carter lived for fourteen years in this helpless
condition, during which time he was a constant
attendant at the church. A light frame and
mattress, on which he lay perfectly prostrate, was
lifted on to a sort of little wheel-carriage, and thus
he was carried into the church, and lay during
the service. Useful for locomotion, this carriage,
sad to relate, was the cause of his death. One
day, the lad who was wheeling him about, lost his
hold at the top of a hill; the carriage ran back
with violence against a wall, and upset the poor
fellow into the road. From that day he sank
rapidly, and died on the 2d of June 1850.</p>

<p>There was a post-mortem examination; and the
injured portion of the spine was removed, and presented
by Professor Hilton to the Museum of the
College of Surgeons, London, 'where it remains,'
as he said in lecturing on the case at the College,
'a typical specimen almost unique in interest.'</p>

<p>[The sight of the drawing of the 'Virgin and
Child,' by Carter, which has been submitted to
our inspection, is eminently suggestive of what
may be done in the most adverse circumstances,
and also rouses sentiments of profound regret at
the sudden and unforeseen death of a being so
highly gifted with the light of genius.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ed.</span>]</p>

<h2><a name="THE_LAST_OF_THE_HADDONS" id="THE_LAST_OF_THE_HADDONS">THE LAST OF THE HADDONS.</a></h2>

<p class='p3'>CHAPTER XIX.&mdash;MRS CHICHESTER'S ARRANGEMENT.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> an hour later, I re-entered the drawing-room
to make my adieu to Miss Farrar, I found
that the aspect of affairs had altogether changed.
She was lounging in her favourite attitude of
negligent ease, in a low chair, playing with the
appendages to her watch-chain; and opposite to
her sat Mrs Chichester.</p>

<p>Marian did not give me time to speak, hurriedly
commencing, with haughty graciousness, the moment
I entered the room.</p>

<p>'Oh, it is Miss Haddon.&mdash;Come in, Miss Haddon.
I am sorry to disappoint you; but I have been
thinking the matter over since I spoke to you,
and have come to the conclusion that I shall not
require your services. The truth is I could not
feel quite sure that you would suit me, and therefore
I have made another arrangement&mdash;a much
more satisfactory one.'</p>

<p>For a moment I did not quite comprehend the
state of affairs, asking myself if she could have
so far misinterpreted my words as to suppose that
I had expressed a wish to remain with her. Then
the truth flashed upon me, and I calmly replied:
'It is quite possible I might not have suited you,
Miss Farrar. If, as I suppose, you have made an
arrangement for Mrs Chichester to reside with
you, I believe you will find her much more amenable
and easy to get on with than I might prove
to be.'</p>

<p>Marian looked at me doubtfully, not quite sure
whether to interpret my words favourably or not.
Mrs Chichester's lips closed tightly for a moment,
then she said with her accustomed gentleness and
suavity: 'The arrangement between Miss Farrar
and myself is so essentially different from ordinary
engagements, Miss Haddon; simply a friendly
one.'</p>

<p>'Yes, indeed,' said Marian, with a grand air.
'Accepting an occasional little offering' (here I
knew she was quoting) 'is quite different from
receiving a salary, you know.'</p>

<p>I cheerfully agreed that it was different; and
was mischievous enough to congratulate 'Miss
Farrar' upon having found so disinterested a
friend in the time of need.</p>

<p>With heightened colour, Mrs Chichester explained
that she had only done what any moderately
good-natured person would do, in offering
to stay with one who had been deserted by those
who ought not to have deserted her.</p>

<p>'Yes; that's what I call it!' said Marian
eagerly catching at the word. 'I've been deserted
by those who ought not to have deserted me!
And here's Caroline, that I never cared for, and
who I thought never cared for me, turns out my
best friend. Caroline had taken a great fancy to me
from the beginning, only she was afraid of shewing
it, in case Lilian should be jealous. But since
my sister has chosen to desert me as she has, she
can't complain about my choosing a fresh friend.
As you know, I have done all I could to make
things pleasant for Lilian. No one in the world
could act more generously than I have done to
her. Any one might tell that, by the heaps and
heaps of things which have been taken out of
the house, without my saying a word. And then
the piano, when it was found that it would have
to be sold on account of being too large for the
cottage, I paid the price it cost two years ago.
Two hundred and fifty pounds for a second-hand
piano, Caroline! I shouldn't mind if I'd been
treated accordingly. But to go away like this,
without so much as saying thank you. As Caroline
says, it is treating one too bad; it really is!'</p>

<p>I glanced smilingly at Caroline's flushed face,
and then wished them good afternoon.</p>

<p>'I hear that you are going to stay at the cottage,
Miss Haddon?'</p>

<p>'For three or four months I am, Mrs Chichester.'</p>

<p>'Until you find another engagement, I presume?'
she asked, eyeing me curiously.</p>

<p>'Until I make another engagement,' I smilingly
replied.</p>

<p>But the 'three or four months' had aroused her
suspicions, though I did not perceive in what
way.</p>

<p>'You have made the best of your sojourn at
Fairview, Miss Haddon'&mdash;softly.</p>

<p>'The very best, Mrs Chichester,' was my cheerful
response; although I did not see the whole
of her meaning, as I was to see it later. I
knew enough to be sure the drift of it was
not very friendly. One thing was very palpable&mdash;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">{244}</a></span>
made no advance in Mrs Chichester's good
graces.</p>

<p>They followed me to the hall with messages for
Lilian.</p>

<p>'I can't forget that she's Pa's daughter, you
know,' said Marian, once more striving to be
generous. 'Give my love to her, and tell her not
to hesitate about sending for anything she may
require from the garden or what not; she will
miss things so at first, you know. And I don't see
why she shouldn't have milk; cook said we have
more than she can use just now. If we go on
keeping two cows she shall always have it. And
say that the very first time we drive out I will
call at the cottage.'</p>

<p>Saunders, who opened the door for me, drew his
hand across his eyes as he strove to stammer out a
message to the 'dear young mistress.'</p>

<p>'Of course you will come to see her; she will
be desirous to hear how you are getting on,
Saunders,' I replied, beginning to find some difficulty
in keeping up my own courage. But there
was more to try me yet. Before I could make my
escape, every servant employed in or about the
house had crowded into the hall, down to Tom the
garden-boy.</p>

<p>'Tell the dear young mistress our hearts ache
for her.' 'Tell her there isn't one here as wouldn't
go barefoot to serve her. God bless her!' 'Tell
her her kindness to mother will never be forgotten
as long as I live.' 'Why didn't she let us say
good-bye, Miss Haddon?' 'Why didn't she shake
hands with us before she went, Miss?'&mdash;they asked
one after the other.</p>

<p>The wisdom of our getting her away as we did
was manifest enough. 'It would have been more
than she could have borne,' I replied, in a broken
voice. 'But it will do her good to hear of your
shewing so much kindly feeling, though she never
doubted your attachment to her. And of course
she expects that you will all go to see her.'</p>

<p>'Ay, that we will!'</p>

<p>Then I got my own share of parting good-wishes,
as we shook hands all round, not at all disturbed
in the process by the sudden slamming of
the drawing-room door and the violent ringing of
a bell.</p>

<p>Satisfactory as it all was from one point of view, I
congratulated myself upon having contrived to
spare Lilian this scene, as well as the final good-bye
to the home that ought to have been her own.</p>

<p>I turned from the main road and walked slowly
down across the fields at the back of Fairview
until I reached the stile at the end of the lane.
Then seating myself upon the cross step, I yielded
to a little sentiment, telling myself that there
must be no such indulgence at the cottage for
some time to come. We needed our full share of
common-sense to keep the atmosphere healthy.
It was all very well trying to assume philosophic
airs about wealth; it did very well in my own case,
for instance; but I really could not see that it was
better for Lilian to lose her large fortune&mdash;and so
lose it. Into what different channels would the
money have passed from her hands, how different
a class of people would have been benefited from
those who would now be the recipients of it.
Granted that Lilian herself might be as happy in
the future as though she possessed a large income,
how many would be the worse for her not possessing
it. The other was already developing a mean
nature, and would grudge expenditure upon anything
which did not immediately minister to her
own gratification. And so forth and so forth I
complained to myself in the short-sighted way
with which many of us are apt to judge when
looking at a question from one point of view only.
I did not even take into consideration the fact that
the loss of fortune had already brought about one
good effect&mdash;that of making Arthur Trafford appear
in his true colours, and so sparing Lilian from
much misery in the future.</p>

<p>'How did she bear it, Miss Haddon?'</p>

<p>I looked up to find Robert Wentworth standing
on the other side the stile. I rose, shook
hands, and replied: 'As you might expect she
would. But we contrived to spare her a final
parting scene;' going on to tell him how we had
managed it.</p>

<p>'A good idea. And Mrs Chichester has stepped
in, has she?' he added musingly. 'Well, I suppose
that might have been expected too. Trafford
will have a useful ally.'</p>

<p>I told him of the offer I had received, smiling
a little over the recital.</p>

<p>'Fortunately you are not like other women;
you can smile at that sort of thing. And you
will not, I trust, be again subjected to anything
of the kind. You will remain at the cottage as
long as you need a home now?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' I replied in a low voice, feeling the hot
colour cover my face in my confusion at hearing
such an allusion from him; wondering not a little
how he had come to know what I had been so
reticent, even to those I loved best, about. His
tone and look seemed, I thought, so plainly to
imply that he did know.</p>

<p>'But I suppose that is forbidden ground just at
present?' he went on, as I imagined answering my
very thoughts.</p>

<p>'Yes,' I whispered stupidly; shy of talking
about my love affair to him, yet a little ashamed
of my shyness, as more befitting a young romantic
girl than myself.</p>

<p>'I will obey'&mdash;glancing down at me with grave
pleasantness&mdash;'if you will consent that some limit
shall be put to the restraint. Shall we say three
months?'</p>

<p>I smiled assent. He really did know then;
even to the time Philip was expected. I did not
like to ask him how he had gained the knowledge,
as that might lead to more talk upon the subject
than I cared to enter into. In fact I was completely
taken by surprise, and not quite equal to
the occasion.</p>

<p>But I soon contrived to account for his knowledge
of my secret. My engagement was well
known to Philip's brother and the latter's friends;
and it was quite possible that Robert Wentworth
might know some of them. But however he
had found it out, I was quite content that he
should have done so. It would be all the easier
to pave the way towards a friendship between
Philip and him, by-and-by. For the present I
quietly returned to the subject which I believed
to be most interesting to him, and we talked over
Lilian's prospects hopefully if a little gravely, as
we walked slowly on down the lane.</p>

<p>'You think there are really some grounds for
hoping that she may forget him?' he asked
anxiously. 'I should not judge hers to be a
changeable mind.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">{245}</a></span></p>

<p>'Changeable! No; if she had really loved
Arthur Trafford, as she fancied she did, there
would be indeed no hope.'</p>

<p>'Fancied?'</p>

<p>'Yes; I firmly believe it <i>was</i> fancy. She never
loved the real Arthur Trafford; she is only just
beginning to know him as he is.'</p>

<p>'Well, I suppose it is all right, so far as she is
concerned; and yet&mdash;constancy in love and friendship
is part of my religion. One does not like to
have that faith disturbed?'&mdash;with what I fancied
was a questioning look.</p>

<p>'You forget that Lilian was almost a child
when the acquaintance commenced; barely sixteen.
Though I hold that she will be constant to
her love, in even ceasing to care for Arthur
Trafford. Do not you see that she has never
known the real man until now&mdash;that in fact she
has been in love with an ideal?' I replied, under
the impression that he was putting the questions
which he wished to be combated, and willing to
indulge him so far.</p>

<p>'It must be rather hard upon a man to discover,
after a long engagement, that he does not accord
with his lady-love's ideal&mdash;all the harder if the
discovery <i>does</i> not happen to be made until after
marriage,' he said; '<i>and</i> I think you will have
to acknowledge that the ideal you talk about
ought to preserve a woman from falling in love
with the counterfeit, rather than lead her to it.'</p>

<p>'You are talking about a woman, and I a girl.'</p>

<p>'You must not forget that she was old enough
to engage herself to him. How if she had continued
in her blindness until too late&mdash;how if she
had become his wife?'</p>

<p>'If she had become his wife before her eyes
were opened, Lilian would in time have recognised
her own weakness in the matter, and blamed
no one else. Moreover, she would have made a
good wife.'</p>

<p>'Yes; I suppose it would have been patched
up that way; by the slow heart-breaking process
of smiling at grief and all the rest of it. And of
course you mean to imply that her fate would
have its use, in the way of serving as a warning
to incautious youth against being in love with
ideals?'</p>

<p>'Of course I meant no such thing, and you
know that I did not,' I replied, laughing outright.
'I should think there is need for a great
deal of the ideal in all love, to keep it alive.'</p>

<p>'Ah, now we are getting on to fresh ground,'
he said enjoyably. 'Let me see, the proposition
is that love needs a great deal of the ideal to keep
it alive; and yet'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>But I was not going to indulge him with a disquisition
upon love; giving him a Roland for an
Oliver, in my own fashion: 'No one is more glad
that Lilian's has turned out to be only an ideal
love, than yourself.'</p>

<p>'Ah, that is not spoken with your usual accuracy
of statement. Should you not rather have said
that no one could be more sorry than I that her
ideal did not preserve her from'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'She <i>is</i> preserved; and that is what you care
most about.'</p>

<p>He smiled. 'Well, perhaps it is.'</p>

<p>When we arrived at the turn in the lane leading
to the cottage, he took leave of me. I did not
invite him to go in with me, and I think he quite
understood my motive for not doing so, this first
evening of our entrance upon a new life. But
he responded as heartily as I could wish, when I
expressed a hope that he would come as frequently
as he could to the cottage; adding that we should
expect a great deal from him now that he had
shewn us how helpful he could be in times of
emergency. 'Besides, it will be good for us, I
suppose, to occasionally see one of the lords of
creation, lest we should come to forget that we are
but women.'</p>

<p>'Yes; you at least require to be occasionally
taken down.'</p>

<p>'You must consider me very amiable to say that
in my presence.'</p>

<p>'Did you hurt your hand when you struck it
upon the seat the other day? From the violence
of the blow, I was afraid you would suffer a little
afterwards.'</p>

<p>'Surely you did not call that temper?'</p>

<p>'O dear, no; I did not venture to call it anything.
What did you call it?'</p>

<p>'Righteous indignation,' I calmly replied.</p>

<p>'Righteous indignation! O indeed. Then if
I have cause to be angry with a person, it is
righteous indignation to attack his friend, and
enforce my arguments by blows upon a piece of
wood?'</p>

<p>'You are worse than usual to-night; but come
soon to see Mrs Tipper and Lilian,' I said, smiling.</p>

<p>'Let us shake hands upon that.'</p>

<p>I stood looking after him a moment, as he
walked away in the twilight with the long, easy,
swinging motion natural to one of a powerfully
built frame. Moreover I knew that his mental
power was at least in equal proportion to his
physical strength, and had no fears as to Lilian's
happiness, by-and-by. The only drawback to her
happiness would be the remembrance of past
weakness, and that may not be the worst kind of
drawback one could have in the time of prosperity.</p>

<p>As we sat that night by the open window, the
May moon flooding the lovely scene outside, resting,
as I persuaded myself, tenderly on <i>my</i> house
by the hill-side, nearly facing us, from the other
side of the village, we told each other that some
people were not intended for a life of luxury and
grandeur, and that we were of their kind; heartily
agreeing that we were now in our proper sphere.</p>

<p>Dear little Mrs Tipper was a bright example
of content and happiness. Never had I seen her
at such advantage as at present. Energetic and
cheerful, company manners packed away with
her best dresses, she was a happy little woman
again, bustling about her small domain in a print-dress
and large apron, and finding a new pleasure
every ten minutes. There was not even the drawback
of anxiety about Lilian in her mind.</p>

<p>She had confided to me that she had never felt
quite satisfied with Arthur Trafford as a husband
for her niece, though she had been afraid to trust
to her own judgment in the matter, lest her want
of appreciation might arise from her ignorance of
society and its ways. But she quite shared my
opinion as to the probability of Lilian's getting
healthily over her disappointment. There was
nothing to prevent her giving expression to her
real sentiments about the change in her life, and
Lilian had the pleasure of knowing that auntie
at least could not be said to be suffering from
reverses.</p>

<p>'It does me real good to do it, my dear; it does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">{246}</a></span>
indeed!' she ejaculated, when I offered to wash
the tea-things for her. 'It all comes so natural
and handy again. Little did I think, when I
packed up these and a few other things and
brought them to brother's unbeknown, that I
should have the pleasure of washing them again.
I couldn't bear to sell them, because they were
father's present to me on my wedding-day, and
nobody has ever washed them but me. You
wouldn't believe how fond I came to be of this
one with the little chip in it, washing it every
day for thirty years. John, he used to be sitting
there by the fire with his pipe,' she went on,
pointing to a corner, and evidently seeing in her
mind's eye the old cottage home, 'and telling
me how things had been going on at the office
in the day; and the news out of the papers&mdash;very
fond of the papers, John was; and he
had the reading of them when the gentlemen had
done with them. And I standing here washing up
the tea-things, and saying a word now and then
to shew him I was listening.&mdash;It all comes back so
plain&mdash;doesn't it?' she added, apostrophising the
cup with tearful eyes. 'I can almost hear the
cuckoo clock ticking against the wall.'</p>

<p>It was time to put in a word, which I did as
gently as possible, and she was presently smiling
cheerily again.</p>

<p>'You mustn't think I'm low-spirited, dear; no,
indeed. There was nothing in those old times
to make me sad; and John's in heaven. All this
only reminded me, you see.'</p>

<p>'I hope you will find Becky useful.'</p>

<p>'That I shall, dear; she's so handy and knows
about things so much, more than you might expect.
It would never have done to have a fine
lady, afraid of spoiling her hands, for a servant
here, you know.' Stopping a moment to open the
door and call out to Becky, at work in the little
scullery at the back: 'You won't forget to order
the currants and candied peel for the cake to-morrow,
Becky. It must not be said we hadn't a
bit of home-made cake when there's dripping in
the house. A good thing I thought of ordering tins;
but that's what I said to the young man; leave
it to me to know what is wanted in the kitchen.'</p>

<p>'I won't forget, ma'am,' called out Becky in
return.</p>

<p>'And, Becky'&mdash;trotting to the door again&mdash;'there's
bedroom candles and soap to be thought
of when the grocer comes in the morning. There
would be no sense in having to send into the town
when we could have it all brought. Don't forget
to look at the little slate, if I'm up-stairs, to see if
there's anything else wanted.'</p>

<p>And so on, and so on, until Lilian and I at last
got her up to her bedroom, fairly tired out, but
as happy as a queen.</p>

<p>I was rejoiced to see how much good it did
Lilian to find that the dear little woman took so
kindly to cottage ways.</p>

<p>'How much worse things might have been,
Mary. How thankful I ought to be!'</p>

<p>'Yes; I think you ought, dearie.'</p>

<p>She and I stood for a few moments at my bedroom
window, gazing at the peaceful scene without.
My room, as they already called it, was at
the back of the cottage; and the window commanded
a view of the woods on the one side, and
the beautiful open country on the other. But we
tacitly agreed to avoid sentiment; we were not
strong enough for that yet. We just let the outside
peace and quiet steal into our hearts, as we
stood there together for a few minutes, my arm
about her, and her cheek resting on my shoulder,
and then bade each other good-night without any
demonstration.</p></div>

<h2><a name="THREE_WONDERFUL_RAILWAYS" id="THREE_WONDERFUL_RAILWAYS">THREE WONDERFUL RAILWAYS.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> 'Three Wonderful Railways' which we propose
to notice are the Brenner, the Semmering,
and the Rigi lines.</p>

<p>The Brenner line, which lies between Innsbruck
and Botzen, and constitutes a portion of the railway
connecting Bavaria and Italy, although it
passes through tunnel after tunnel, until the weary
traveller is prone to abandon all hope of obtaining
any view of the scenery, nevertheless is not content
with getting <i>through</i> the pass, but proudly
mounts to the top and passes over the summit
level before beginning the descent. The pass is a
low one, indeed one of the lowest over the main
Alps; but then it must be borne in mind that this
'low' Alpine pass is four thousand seven hundred
and seventy-five feet high; no mean altitude for a
railway. Neither is it merely for its height that
the writer is induced to describe it, nor for its
pretty scenery (it can scarcely be called grand),
but for the extraordinary engineering difficulties
which the making of the line presented, and which
have been so ably and ingeniously overcome.
Some of the more ordinary difficulties of the district
traversed by the line may be gathered from
the fact that the ascent from Innsbruck involves no
fewer than thirteen tunnels, while in the descent
there are ten. The line, clinging to the side of
the mountain, has to penetrate projecting rocks
so frequently that it strongly resembles, except in
the lovely peeps obtained in the momentary intervals,
the Metropolitan District Railway; which
is dignified by the name of the 'Daylight Route,'
because it is not always underground. In its course
up the valley the railway on one side sometimes
rises above the level of the carriage-road on the
other, sometimes finds itself considerably below it.
In climbing the pass, the rail of course never ceases
to ascend; while the more humble road bows to the
obstacles it encounters, and rises and falls according
to the nature of the ground. At last, Nature
seems determined to put a stop to the encroachments
of steam, and the railroad finds itself directly
facing a lateral valley, the bottom of which lies far
below it.</p>

<p>Now how to get over this valley and pursue the
direct course up the main valley, seems a problem.
The road would descend to mount again; not so
the rail. The difficulty and its solution may be
well realised by imagining a railway cut in the face
of a long row of houses (which must be supposed
to represent one side of the main valley). This
railway, starting from one end of the row at the
basement level, gradually rises, in order to pass
over the roofs (that is, the head of the pass) of
another row of houses at right angles to and at the
end of the first row. In its course it encounters a
side-street (the lateral valley) with no outlet at the
other end, and which is too broad to be spanned
with a bridge. Now the line at this point has
reached the second floor; and to get to the opposite
houses and pursue its course, it turns a sharp
corner, runs along one side of the blind street,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">{247}</a></span>
crosses it at the further or blind end by merely
clinging still to the houses, returns along the other
side, rounds the corner into the main street, and
resumes its course. During this dÃ©tour the ascent
has been continued uninterruptedly, so that on the
return of the line to the desired opposite corner it
has mounted to the third floor. Applying this
illustration, the reader will perceive the ingenious
yet simple solution of the difficulty.</p>

<p>The effect on reaching the first corner of the
lateral valley is most remarkable. The line is
seen at the opposite corner far above the traveller's
head entering a tunnel; and how he is going to get
there is a puzzle which he hardly solves before he
finds himself on the spot looking down on the
corner he has just left, wondering how he ever
came from there.</p>

<p>But even this striking instance of engineering
triumphs is eclipsed by a portion of the line on
the other side of the pass. Pursuing the direction
he has already come, the traveller has stopped in
the descent at Schelleberg, a small station perched
at an enormous height above an expansive valley,
when he perceives a village five hundred feet
almost perpendicularly below him, which he is
informed is the next station. It would not take
long to reach this village (Gossensass) in a lift,
but in a train he has to run far past it, always
descending, then turn completely round, and run
back again in the direction he has come from, but
now on a level with Gossensass. But at the point
where this evolution has to be made occurs another
lateral valley, much longer than the first alluded
to; and this time one which it is not desired to
cross, as Gossensass lies as it were on the basement
of the house on the third floor of which is Schelleberg.
The train proceeds, therefore, to turn the
corner into the side-street as before; but without
pursuing the street to its end, it suddenly dives
into one of the houses, makes a complete circuit
of its interior, and emerges in the opposite direction;
returning to the corner whence it started by
means of the same houses, but on a lower floor.
The appearance of this engineering feat is quite
bewildering; and after tunnelling into the hill on
the sharp curve, and then finding himself proceeding
back towards the place he has just come from,
the traveller experiences a difficulty in believing
that the line parallel with him, but almost over
his head, is the one he has just been passing over.
Shortly after Gossensass has been left behind, the
train passes close under and almost into the
gigantic and formidable-looking fort of Franzensfeste;
and then after a few more tunnels, gradually
leaves the Alps behind, and descends by
Botzen into the Italian plains with all their
luxuriant foliage. It should be added that the
Brenner line was completed in the year 1867, and
that its numerous engineering difficulties entailed
an average cost of about twenty-eight thousand
pounds per mile.</p>

<p>The Semmering line, which lies south of
Vienna, on the way thence to Trieste, and which,
until the completion of the Brenner, was unique
in the boldness of its conception and execution,
as also for the height to which it attained, is
now eclipsed as to altitude in more than one instance;
but as a magnificent engineering achievement
it can hold its own against any railway
at present constructed. While resembling the
Brenner in many particulars, it differs from it
in some important points. Among these differences
is the fact, that whereas the Brenner line
actually surmounts the pass, the Semmering, on
reaching a height of two thousand eight hundred
and ninety-three feet, or about four hundred feet
short of the summit, suddenly, as if tired of so
much climbing, plunges into the ground, and only
emerges again nearly a mile off, and on the other
side of the pass, which it then proceeds to descend.
It is thus that it may be said to have been the
prototype of its great successor, the Mont Cenis.</p>

<p>The Semmering further differs from the Brenner
in what may perhaps be considered its most
remarkable feature&mdash;namely, its viaducts. For
while the latter avoids many a yawning abyss by
some ingenious curve, the former seems almost to
seek the opportunity for a magnificent display of
span. These viaducts occur frequently, being as
many as fifteen in number; and in many instances
are formed of a double row of arches, one standing
on the other in the manner sometimes adopted by
the Romans in the construction of their aqueducts.
To realise the grandeur of these viaducts, they
should not be seen merely from a train, but the
traveller should contrive to view them from below.
The finest is over the Kalte Rinne, and consists of
five arches below and ten above. The line also in
places requires to be protected from avalanches of
stone or of snow, and this is effected by means of
covered galleries, such as may be seen on so many
Alpine roads. The tunnels too are as numerous as
the viaducts. In fact the train no sooner emerges
from a tunnel than it finds itself skimming over a
viaduct, only to plunge once more into a tunnel or
a gallery. The device for crossing a lateral valley
described above in the case of the Brenner is also
resorted to here, and need not be further alluded
to.</p>

<p>The proportionate cost of the Semmering railway
was more than double that of the Brenner,
being about sixty thousand pounds per mile.
This may be accounted for partly by the fact, that
the former was constructed and opened thirteen
years prior to the latter; by which the latter was
enabled to reap the benefit of the engineering
experience acquired in the progress of its predecessor.
But the chief cause of this enormous
difference in the cost of construction lies in the
different modes adopted for overcoming obstacles;
and the vast viaducts of the Semmering entailed
an expense which was wisely and ingeniously
avoided in the construction of the Brenner.</p>

<p>The gradients, as may be supposed, are very steep
on both these railways, and the rate of speed not
great. On the Semmering a long train has to be
divided into two or three portions, to enable it to
surmount these steep slopes, which frequently are
as rapid as one in forty, even on the viaducts and
in the tunnels. The reader has only to notice the
numbers on the gradient indicators by the side of
an English railway, to be able to judge what an
incline of <i>one in forty</i> is like.</p>

<p>But if one in forty seems steep, what shall be
said of one in four, which is the gradient of a large
part of the Rigi railway? No doubt the ascent of
the Rigi has come to be regarded much as the
Londoner regards the ascent of Primrose Hill;
though in the latter case the hardy traveller has to
use the means of locomotion with which Nature
has provided him in order to reach the summit;
while in the former he merely seats himself in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">{248}</a></span>
railway carriage at the base of the mountain, and
is deposited without the smallest exertion on his
part at or nearly at the top.</p>

<p>Steam here, as elsewhere, has almost entirely
superseded the old means of travel. But as if
it were not a sufficiently stupendous undertaking
to have one railway to the top of a mountain,
two have here been constructed, one having
its base at Art on the Lake of Zug, the other
at Vitznau on the Lake of Lucerne. Taking
the latter, which was first accomplished, the
height to be scaled is four thousand four hundred
and seventy-two feet from the level of the
Lake of Lucerne, the total altitude of the mountain
being five thousand nine hundred and five
feet above the level of the sea. Of this four
thousand four hundred and seventy-two feet, the
rail accomplishes all but one hundred feet or so.
To do this, an excessively steep gradient must be
constantly maintained, as the formation of the
mountain does not admit of wide sweeps, dÃ©tours,
or zigzags; but the course pursued is round the
shoulder, then along the ridge which communicates
with the topmost heights, and finally up
those heights themselves, a distance of not more
than eight miles. It is thus that a gradient of one
in four becomes a necessity. Let the reader mark
out a distance of four feet, and at one end place a
foot-rule perpendicularly. A line drawn from one
end of this distance to the top of the rule at the
other end will indicate the gradient of one in four.
It is a steeper incline than horses and carriages are
expected to surmount, yet trains pass up and down
constantly without difficulty, and it is confidently
asserted, without more danger than on ordinary
lines. The rate of speed is of course not high, one
hour twenty minutes being occupied in the ascent,
and a slightly less time in the descent.</p>

<p>The construction of the train is remarkable. It
consists of an engine with small tender and but
one carriage. An ordinary locomotive would be
powerless on such steep gradients, therefore one of
peculiar construction is used, which is of itself an
extraordinary object. On level ground it appears
as if it had completely broken down and lost two
of its wheels. This arises from the fact that, being
expressly intended to work on an incline, it is built
in such a way as to compensate for the incline and
maintain the boiler in a vertical position. This
boiler in appearance resembles nothing so much
as a large beer bottle standing upright when the
train is ascending or descending, but very much
out of the perpendicular when on level ground.
The small tender is of course constructed so as to
have its floor level when on the incline. Its sides
are of wire-work, and are made thus with the
object of reducing the weight as much as possible;
an object which is also carried out both in the
engine and in the carriage, which are as light as
they can be made, it not being necessary to prevent
the wheels jumping from the rails by the pressure
of great weight as on ordinary lines, where a high
rate of speed is attained. This tender, in addition
to its usual functions, performs the office of carrying
surplus passengers on an emergency.</p>

<p>The carriage is an open car, rather resembling a
block of low pews taken from a church, placed on
wheels, and surmounted by an awning, with curtains
to let down at the sides, as a protection against the
weather. The seats, which are nine in number,
and accommodate six persons each, all face one
way&mdash;namely, downhill; and a fixed footstool serves
to keep the passengers from sliding off their seats.
Contrary to the usual order, the carriage on this
line precedes the locomotive in the ascent, and is
pushed instead of being pulled up the incline. In
the descent the locomotive takes the first place,
and exercises merely a retarding force. It will be
seen, therefore, that the two portions of the train
are necessarily in close connection when in motion,
and for this reason, as well as for purposes of
safety, couplings are dispensed with. Each portion
is provided with its own brake-power, so that
in the event of the engine getting beyond control,
the carriage can be stopped and rendered entirely
independent, since it is not coupled to the engine.
The brake is of course of a totally different kind
from that in ordinary use, which would be of no
service whatever on such inclines, as the wheels,
even if the brake were so powerful as to stop their
revolution, would slide down the hill by the mere
force of gravity. Here, however, the brake consists
in an ingenious adaptation of the means
which are employed in driving the engine.</p>

<p>The roadway is laid with three rails, the outer
ones being of the usual kind, while the central one
is a long-toothed rack, of which the teeth are
perpendicular. Into this rack fit the teeth of the
pinions or cogged-wheels with which both engine
and carriage are provided. Now it is apparent
that if these wheels are put in motion they will
pull the train along the rack; and if stopped and
held firmly in one position, they will prevent any
onward motion by the mere clinching of the teeth,
to use a common expression. One of the cogged-wheels,
then, which are attached to the engine
is the driving-wheel, and forms the special means
of locomotion, while the other cogged-wheels of
course merely revolve without exercising any
traction. But immediately a halt is required, all
these wheels become of equal importance, and
supply a prompt and most efficient brake, since
directly they are locked, the train is brought to a
stand-still, and held as in a vice even on the
steepest inclines. Other brake-power is also
applied; but this would seem to be the efficient
means of control in case of accident.</p>

<p>It will be seen, therefore, that the danger of the
train running away is carefully provided against;
and no less care has been bestowed on the means
for preventing the train leaving the rails, a danger
fully as alarming as the other on a line which, for
the greater part of its course, runs on the brink of
a fearful precipice. Along each side of the central
or rack rail, which is raised some inches from the
ground, runs a projecting edge; and the engine
and carriage are provided with two strong rods,
the ends of which are bent in such a manner as to
pass under these projections. Any jerk or jump
of the train, therefore, would be resisted by the
pressure of these bent ends against the under
surface of the projections.</p>

<p>It is not within the province of this paper to
speak of the hotels which form such huge excrescences
on the mountains' sides and top (by no
means an improvement on nature), or to allude to
the hundreds of tourists who daily swarm in these
hotels, or to the hundreds of others who take the
journey for the sake of a 'new sensation.' It may,
however, be mentioned that from one of the stations
(Rigi Staffel) runs a branch-line which communicates
with the Rigi Scheideck, where is situated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">{249}</a></span>
one of the largest of the hotels; and that the line
from Art joins the Vitznau line near the summit.
It will thus be seen that the Rigi is traversed in
all directions by railways; and according to the
opinion of an intelligent Swiss with whom the
writer conversed, these railways owe their origin
to the fact that the Germans, who have now
become such a travelling nation, will not penetrate
in any numbers where they cannot travel by horse,
by carriage, or by steam; and he further indicated
his opinion of Germans by adding, that no doubt
ere long, a lift would be constructed to work up
and down the perpendicular face of the Matterhorn
for their benefit. Who shall say that such a
thing is impossible?</p></div>

<p class='p3'>IN TWO PARTS.</p>

<h3>PART I.&mdash;SUNSHINE.</h3>


<h4>CHAPTER VII.&mdash;ISAAC IS TOUCHED.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Isaac</span> allowed a few days to elapse before he paid
his promised visit; and then one evening, after
an early chop, he sallied forth in search of the
address on Miss Faithful's card, No. 61 New West
Road, Holloway. He found the house without
much difficulty; and a snug little house it was.
His three friends were at home, and appeared
very pleased to see him; that is to say, the two
younger members of the party appeared pleased,
the elder lady being in a more or less somnolent
state in the arm-chair, and to some extent unconscious
of his presence. The first greetings and the
general remarks upon the weather being ended,
Herbert proposed some music. Angela turned to
their visitor, and asked him his favourite songs.
If she had asked him his favourite Greek plays,
poor Isaac could hardly have been more nonplussed.
He was not much assisted either by the
cursory examination he gave a music-case containing
a number of her songs, which she considerately
handed to him; so he was fain to
acknowledge that he did not know any tunes for
certain, except a few hymns he had heard in
church, <i>God Save the Queen</i>, and a few popular
melodies he had heard the boys whistle in the
streets. So Herbert came to the rescue, and picked
out one or two of his favourites for her to sing.
She did so; and then Isaac's mind, which had to
a great extent resumed its original state of reserve,
reopened again to the genial sunshine of her
manner and the beauty of her voice; for there
was something irresistible to him in this singing
of hers; he could not account for it even to
himself; but it was the 'open sesame' to his heart
and confidence.</p>

<p>She sang several songs and a couple of duets
with her brother; and then, as the evening closed
in, the three sat at the open window chatting&mdash;Miss
Faithful meanwhile being peacefully asleep
in her chair. Isaac, under the influence of the
spell, experienced a nearer approach to delight
than he had ever done before, and quite unbosomed
himself to his new friends. He gave them an
account of his parentage, of his home, or rather
lodging, at Dambourne End, of his cottages and
garden-ground, and of his resources and prospects
generally. They listened with evident interest,
and with a few judicious questions, obtained the
complete biography of their visitor.</p>

<p>At length the gas was lighted, supper was
brought in, and aunt aroused from her doze.
After the meal, Angela went up-stairs with her,
and Isaac and Herbert were left to themselves.
But there was not much to be got from the former
in the way of conversation, now the spell was
removed; and as he was in the habit of retiring
to bed early (to save lights), and as he had partaken
of an unaccustomed meal in the form of
supper, he soon grew very drowsy, so arose to
say good-night. Herbert called his sister down-stairs
to go through this salutation, and said he
would accompany Isaac on his walk to the coffee-house
and smoke his cigar by the way. At
parting, he said he should look Isaac up one
evening, and if agreeable to him, they would go
together to some place of amusement. But in the
meantime he was to stand upon no ceremony, but
to come and see them whenever he would.</p>


<h4>CHAPTER VIII.&mdash;THE LEAP.</h4>

<p>About a week after Isaac had paid his first visit
to New West Road, he was one evening finishing
his solitary meal, when Mr Herbert Faithful was
announced. 'I am come to take you back with me,'
he said, 'for Angela has threatened me with an
evening to myself, as she is very busy trying on a
dress for a ball to which we are going; and <i>I</i> can't
stand loneliness if <i>you</i> can; so come with me, and
we'll have a cigar together.'</p>

<p>'I will go with you,' said Isaac; 'but I cannot
smoke; I never tried.'</p>

<p>So in a few minutes they were on their way to
Miss Faithful's house, and the conversation turned
on the coming ball.</p>

<p>'I quite imagine it will be rather a showy affair,'
said Herbert; 'and I more than half suspect that it
is arranged for a special purpose. It is given by a
Mrs Ashton, an old friend of my mother, and her
son is an old sweetheart of Angela. He has never
proposed exactly, as he was considered too young;
but this ball is to be given on his birthday, and I
expect Angela will come home an engaged girl.
She is a dear girl,' he continued with a sigh;
'but it is only reasonable that she should be
getting married before long.'</p>

<p>Isaac's heart gave a great bound, but he answered
nothing. His companion was silent also
after this, and in a few minutes they reached his
aunt's house.</p>

<p>To her brother's apparent surprise, Angela was
in the hall to welcome them. 'It is all very fine,
Master Herbert,' she said, 'for you to run off as
soon as I promise you an evening to yourself down-stairs;
but do not think you are to monopolise Mr
Webb's company.'</p>

<p>'But how about the dress?' asked Herbert.</p>

<p>'Oh, that did not take long, for it fits beautifully.
But somehow or other I do not care so much about
the ball as I did.'</p>

<p>'Well, I like that!' said Herbert. 'Perhaps you
are afraid you will have to sit down a good part of
the evening, for want of a partner. If you are
asked to be any one's partner, be careful to ascertain
that it is for the dance <i>only</i>, and not for anything
beyond that.'</p>

<p>'Be quiet, Herbert, do,' said his sister, colouring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">{250}</a></span></p>

<p>'Don't be angry, dear, for a little fraternal solicitude.
But come, suppose you give us a rehearsal
of the songs you intend to sing. Mind there is
nothing about love in them.'</p>

<p>'Herbert, you are incorrigible; you don't deserve
a song.&mdash;What do <i>you</i> think, Mr Webb?'</p>

<p>Mr Webb coughed, coloured, stammered, and
finally said he 'hoped she'd sing one.'</p>

<p>'Well, it would be a shame to punish the innocent
with the guilty, so I consent; but you must
stop your ears, Herbert.' With these words, Angela
looked out one or two songs, opened the piano,
and once again wove the spell around Isaac's mind
and heart; so much so, that though he was not
of a jealous nature, he yet could not bear the
thought that she would sing these same songs, and
captivate the ear of the man who would in all
probability ask her to be his wife. No; the idea
was horrible; and as he listened, and the spell
wrought its power around him and within him,
his heart throbbed bolder and bolder, and he
resolved to make a rush and forestall his hopeful
rival. Yes; he would offer his cottages, his
garden-ground, and his heart; and would not,
moreover, risk his chance by waiting until this
hateful ball was over. If he did, it would be lost.
And why risk <i>any</i> delay? No; he would not;
so determined he would act that very evening.</p>

<p>But would he be successful? He would have
felt but little doubt had there been no rival, or
only a weak one, to forestall; and even as it
was, he did not consider his case was bad, much
less desperate. It was scarcely likely that Angela
would throw away a certain chance for an uncertain
one, especially when that chance was Isaac Webb&mdash;a
deep shrewd young fellow, and backed moreover
by the cottages and garden-ground. So when the
evening had worn itself away, and it was time for
him to take his departure, Isaac requested Herbert
to walk part of the way home with him, as he had
something he wanted to say to him.</p>

<p>'Do you think,' he asked Herbert, when they
were on the road, 'that your sister has made up
her mind to accept Mr Ashton?'</p>

<p>'I do not know that he will ask her,' Herbert
answered; 'but if he were to do so, I had no doubt
she would until just lately; but now I am not quite
so sure about it. But excuse me; why do you ask
such a question?'</p>

<p>'Because,' returned Isaac, 'I&mdash;I have been
thinking of taking a wife, and&mdash;well, I&mdash;I think
I should like to have <i>her</i>.'</p>

<p>'Well, you <i>do</i> astonish me,' said Herbert. 'And
yet,' he continued, after a pause, 'perhaps I can
now account for my doubt as to her affection for
young Ashton. But you had better ask her point-blank
whether she will have you; that is, if you
have really made up your mind about it.'</p>

<p>'That is just what I want <i>you</i> to do,' exclaimed
Isaac. 'I want you to ask her for me.'</p>

<p>'Excuse me, my dear fellow; but it is rather a
delicate subject for me&mdash;her brother&mdash;to put before
her'&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>'So much the better,' interrupted Isaac. 'It
will come better from you, and with more weight
than from me.'</p>

<p>'But people would say directly that I had somehow
caused you to do it.'</p>

<p>'People need not know anything at all about
it,' answered Isaac.</p>

<p>'But you have known her such a little while,'
urged Herbert; 'and you may not fully have made
up your mind; or you may alter it.'</p>

<p>'No, no!' returned Isaac decidedly. 'I have
made up my mind enough, and I would rather you
ask her than me. I should not know quite what
to say.'</p>

<p>'You would know quite as well as I. However,
anything for the dear girl's happiness; and since
you will have it so, I will do it. But when would
you like me to ask her?'</p>

<p>'Oh, as soon as you can,' said the amorous Isaac.</p>

<p>'Very well. Then if there's a chance to-morrow,
I will see about it, and will let you know the
result.'</p>

<p>'Thank you,' said Isaac, much relieved. So they
shook hands and parted.</p>

<p>The love-sick youth was in a considerable state
of excitement all the night long; he tossed about
on his bed, and wondered why the traffic outside
made so much more noise than usual. At last
he fell asleep, and dreamed of Angela&mdash;and her
expectations. The following morning, contrary to
his usual habit, he was very late at breakfast;
and when he had finished, had no inclination for
his customary stroll through the streets, but sat
in his room reading, or attempting to read, two
very old newspapers and a playbill. To pass
the time, he had his dinner in the middle of the
day, and afterwards dropped off to sleep&mdash;an
unusual proceeding, doubtless caused by his disturbed
night. He was aroused about six o'clock
by his landlady entering the room.</p>

<p>'A note for you, sir. The lad said there was no
answer.'</p>

<p>It was from Herbert, and contained the gratifying
announcement that he had executed Isaac's
commission, and that his sister, 'much surprised
and flattered by Mr Webb's sentiments, could
assure him that they were entirely reciprocated by
her, and that she would endeavour to make herself
worthy of his choice. Would he be so kind as to
postpone a visit for a day or two, that she might
in some degree recover herself from the flutter of
her surprise, and be able to receive him as she
would wish?'</p>

<p>Bravo, Isaac! You are a deep dog; and your
life and your schemes seem flooded with sunshine.</p>


<h3>PART II.&mdash;CLOUD.</h3>


<h4>CHAPTER I.&mdash;THE SUN IS SLIGHTLY OBSCURED.</h4>

<p>Mr Herbert Faithful in his letter to Isaac had
requested him to postpone a visit to his sister for
a few days, in order that she might recover herself
from the excitement his proposal had occasioned.
This may have been partly the truth; but the real
fact was that Herbert wished to satisfy himself
that Isaac's account of himself was a truthful one,
before he and Angela met for the ratification of
their engagement. So he took this opportunity
to make a hurried visit to Dambourne; and by
the brief but well-directed inquiries he made there,
was enabled to arrive at the conclusion that Isaac's
version of himself and of his circumstances was
a correct one. Having thus done his duty as a
prudent brother, Herbert sent, as soon as possible
after his return, an invitation to Isaac to visit
New West Road.</p>

<p>Angela had apparently made good use of the
interval to recover herself from 'the flutter of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">{251}</a></span>
surprise.' At all events she shewed very few
traces of it when Isaac was, for the first time since
their engagement, announced. Not that she appeared
unduly unconscious of the new relations
between them; but she carried off all the constraint
and stiffness of manner that were natural
under the circumstances, by that unaffected and
lady-like self-possession which formed one of her
most striking characteristics, and which at once
put her too self-conscious lover at his ease. That
young man was indeed in such a mingled state of
nervousness and excitement, that it is extremely
doubtful whether he would have ventured to refer
to the happy position she had granted him, but
from her meeting him half-way, as it were; for
the idea was implied by her manner that there
was no need of constraint on his part, for that
they met on equal terms, and that she could not
but be gratified by his having bestowed upon her
his regard. Such at least was the light in which
Isaac regarded Angela's manner towards him on
this their first meeting as lovers, and it had the
effect, as has been stated, of putting him at his ease.</p>

<p>Her brother kindly assisted at this consummation;
for he welcomed Isaac with a frank kindness
that made the latter consider him, next to himself,
the best fellow in the world.</p>

<p>The only member of the family who remained
as before was the aunt. Her deafness, poor soul,
had, quite suddenly, much increased, and her
general faculties had, in proportion apparently,
decreased, so that she had become a complete
nonentity, and her slate and pencil had all but
retired on a handsome competence of illegible
scrawls.</p>

<p>After half an hour's general conversation, Herbert
pleaded an engagement, and the lovers were
(putting Miss Faithful out of the question) left to
themselves.</p>

<p>'I was so pleased with your brother's letter,'
said Isaac. 'I thought, somehow, that my regard
and admiration for you were returned.'</p>

<p>This was not quite what he intended to say;
but the part of the ardent lover was so new to him
that he could not all at once settle down into it.</p>

<p>'Indeed,' Angela replied, 'Herbert's letter could
give but little idea of my surprise and&mdash;well, I
suppose I need not mind saying it now&mdash;gratification.
But I cannot imagine what you have seen
in me in so short a time, to have caused you to
make such a proposal as you have.' Whether
she intended it or not, Angela could not have
gone more directly to that most sensitive and
vulnerable portion of Isaac's temperament, his
self-esteem. He received her reply as a well-merited
compliment, but he had not the grace to
return it.</p>

<p>'I don't exactly know myself,' was his curt
rejoinder. 'Don't you think,' he continued after
a pause, 'that we may as well be getting married
pretty soon? I want to be going back to look
after the cottages, and it will come so expensive
to be going backwards and forwards; and I have
never been used to writing many letters.'</p>

<p>'Oh, you must talk to Herbert about that.
When he thinks it right for us to be married, I
shall be ready.'</p>

<p>It must be confessed that this was a very
practical way of looking at the matter on this the
first evening of their engagement; but Isaac looked
on the whole subject of matrimony and its attendant
evils, courtship included, in a very practical
and business-like manner. Such, then, was the
opening conversation of these lovers, and it grew
no warmer as it proceeded. After a short time,
Angela went to the piano and sang several songs,
to Isaac's great delight. The spell was again
woven around him; and when Herbert returned
home, our hero could have been guided anywhere
by him or his sister, had either of them been
disposed to do so.</p>

<p>One circumstance in connection with his engagement
was a slight satisfaction to Isaac: he
would be often visiting at Miss Faithful's house
and partaking of her hospitality; so that he would
then be able to live more economically at his
coffee-shop. Even this, however, would not balance
the amount of the expense of his absence from
home; so, after mature consideration, he arrived
at the conclusion that an early marriage was
desirable; for he dreaded the season of courtship,
and wanted to get the matter closed. So he
decided still to remain in London for the present,
and take an early opportunity to urge his views
with Herbert.</p>

<p>It did not occur to Isaac that there was anything
to cause delay. Surely a respectable young
woman could be married at any time, and he did
not know of any law preventing them being
married to-morrow if they chose. He did not
desire, it is true, anything quite so speedy as that,
but he considered that say three weeks or a month
ought to be sufficient for all preparation. But the
mention of some such sentiments as these to
Herbert received from him a very decided check.</p>

<p>'Why,' said he, laughing, 'apart from everything
else, you and Angela have not even decided where
you intend to live. It will take you a month to
do that, let alone the furnishing.'</p>

<p>'We shall live at Dambourne End of course,'
said Isaac; 'and my lodgings are quite large
enough for two people, or can easily be made so.'</p>

<p>'Seriously,' returned Herbert, 'that is quite out
of the question; for if <i>Angela</i> agreed to it, I tell
you candidly <i>I</i> would not; for she has always
been accustomed to a comfortable home, and you
are well enough off between you to have one when
you are married. And between you and me, I do
not think a little country place, such as you
have described Dambourne End to be, is quite a
suitable place to which to take a young wife who
has spent the greater part of her life in London,
and has until lately mixed a good bit in society.
Not that she wants to do so again, or to run into
extravagance; but to take her away from all her
friends and associations, at all events just at first,
and for no particular reason, would not be quite
the thing, I fancy. I don't want to throw cold-water
on your plans, old fellow,' he continued,
laying his hand on Isaac's arm, 'or to seem in any
way to dictate; but just think over what I have
said, and I think you will see the force of it.'</p>

<p>Isaac was too much astonished at the idea
Herbert had broached to make any reply to it, so
took his leave.</p>


<h4>CHAPTER II.&mdash;SHADOWS DEEPEN.</h4>

<p>Our hero's cogitations on his way home were cut
short on his arrival by a letter which was waiting
for him from the old schoolfellow to whom he had
confided the care of his estate at Dambourne.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">{252}</a></span>
This letter was calculated to give him some uneasiness.
It was as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>&mdash;I am afraid there is something
not quite right about the stranger who took
your lodgings at Mrs Clappen's, or else about
the tenants of your cottages, or both; for when
I went to collect the rents according to your
wish, a week or two after you went away, the
people in the cottages all laughed at me; and when
I went again a few days ago, they threatened
to put me under the pump. The reason that I
think Mrs Clappen's lodger has something to do
with it is that I have seen him go into some of the
cottages at different times; but when I asked his
landlady what he did there, she said she believed
he went giving away tracts. But this morning she
came to me in a great state of excitement saying
two strange men were watching her house, and that
her lodger had not been out of his room all the
morning, and had not had his breakfast, and altogether
she thought there must be something
wrong. I went back with her and knocked at his
door. As he did not answer, and as the door was
locked on the inside, I broke it open; but the
stranger had gone&mdash;probably through the back
window and down by the water-butt. Your box
is in the room, and I find it is <i>unlocked</i>. As I do
not know what you may have left in it, I write to
let you know about it.&mdash;Yours truly,</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Frederick Jones</span>.
</p></div>

<p>Here was a pretty state of things. This lodger
had most likely broken open Isaac's box and
abstracted what things of value it contained.
Fortunately there was not very much&mdash;only about
forty pounds in gold and some title-deeds. He
reflected what he should do. Perhaps he ought to
go down to Dambourne End at once, but he did
not see what good he could do if he went; so he
decided to wait until the following day, and let
Angela know about it. Accordingly, the next
morning he started off to New West Road, and
informed Angela and her brother of his ill news.
It did not, however, make the impression upon
them that Isaac expected; for they made light of
it, and said that if his loss were no more than
forty pounds, <i>that</i> was of no very great consequence.
They did not know that <i>any</i> amount of
money, however small, was of consequence to Isaac.</p>

<p>'I'll tell you what,' cried Herbert; 'if you will
wait until to-morrow, Angela and I will go down
with you.&mdash;Mrs Glubbs will come in and look
after aunt, Angela.'</p>

<p>Isaac hailed the proposition with joy; for he
had already grown to have great confidence in
Herbert and his knowledge of the world&mdash;indeed
he considered it but little inferior to his own&mdash;and
he thought that if there were much wrong down
at Dambourne, their united experience and sagacity
would in all probability speedily set it right.</p>

<p>'And now, old fellow, I want a chat with you
for an hour, if you can spare the time,' said
Herbert; and as Angela at that moment left the
room, he continued: 'I want to speak to you on
the subject we were discussing last evening. Have
you thought over what I said?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' Isaac answered; 'but not much, for this
other affair has put it out of my head for the time.'</p>

<p>'Oh, never mind this little affair,' returned
Herbert; 'it is not worth troubling about. Anybody
would think you were not worth forty
pence to hear how you talk. And that brings me
to the subject I want to speak to you about.
Angela has an objection to live at your little
country place, though not so great an objection as
I have to her doing so. And there is no need for
you to drone your lives away down there; come
up to London and enjoy yourselves. You say you
have about two hundred and fifty a year. Well,
my sister on her marriage will come into three
hundred and fifty a year or thereabouts; and she
will probably have a little more whenever anything
happens to aunt. The former income she
inherits from mother's family, and it is to accumulate
until she is married, or if single, until she
reaches the age of thirty-five&mdash;now twelve years
off. Until one or other of these events happen
she cannot touch a penny of it. This puts her in
a very peculiar and uncomfortable position; because
though father left us enough to live upon,
yet it is nothing more, and so whatever preparations
you make for your wedding, you must make
on trust of what I tell you.'</p>

<p>'O yes,' said Isaac; 'pray do not think&mdash;either
of you&mdash;that I have not confidence in you.'</p>

<p>'That is very kind and generous of you,'
Herbert replied, 'because we shall be compelled,
under the circumstances I have told you, to test
that confidence. Now what we propose is this,'
he continued: 'Angela seems to have a great
desire to live in the neighbourhood of London,
and if you will find a suitable house and furnish
it, and have it ready in three months from this
time, she will be ready by then to be married.
But it has occurred to us that as you are not
very well acquainted with London, it may save
you some trouble and expense (supposing you
agree to our proposition) if you like to leave it
to us to fix on the locality and find a house;
more especially as I have many friends in different
parts of London. But if you prefer to act on your
own account, pray do not hesitate to say so.'</p>

<p>Isaac sat and weighed the matter in his mind.
Certainly Angela's income was considerably more
than he had any idea of, so he need not be so
very pinching. On the other hand, he did not
much relish the idea of a lavish expenditure over
a house and furniture. And yet if Angela would
not live at Dambourne End, it did not matter
where they lived, so far as he was concerned.
And again there rose up the three hundred and
fifty a year, and more expectations! Much better
than he had expected to do in any matrimonial
speculation he had ever contemplated. In addition
to these reasons he was by no means obstinate
in disposition, and yielded easily to any one in
whom he had confidence, and who, as the term
goes, 'got the right side of him.' Angela and
her brother had contrived to do this. So after a
few minutes' thought, Isaac agreed to Herbert's
proposal, with one amendment: that if the house
were ready in time, the marriage should take place
in two months instead of three.</p>

<p>'And,' said Isaac, when this was agreed to, 'on
condition that you make all the necessary preparations
for me.'</p>

<p>'Yes, if you really wish it,' said Herbert. 'But
excuse me speaking plainly: you must advance
me the money if I do.'</p>

<p>'Yes, I suppose I must,' Isaac answered ruefully.
'How much do you think you will want, and

<p>'I should think five hundred pounds would do,
at all events for the present. Of course I will be
as careful with it as I can, for your interests and

things good at first, since they are the more
economical in the long-run. The money you can
let me have whenever it is convenient to you.'</p>

<p>'You shall have the sum you mention in about

<p>Angela now came in dressed for a walk, so
Herbert and Isaac broke up their conference, and
the three went out together.</p></div>

<h2><a name="IMPORTED_BEEF_AND_MUTTON" id="IMPORTED_BEEF_AND_MUTTON">IMPORTED BEEF AND MUTTON.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">A resolute</span> attempt was made a dozen years ago
to import fresh beef in various forms from Buenos
Ayres; and as the meat was sold at a comparatively
low price, there arose high expectations on
the subject. The well-meant attempt failed. It
would not do. The meat presented an unpleasant
appearance. The working classes in this country
did not like the flavour, even if the appearance
had been good; they would not buy, although the
price was low; and thus the affair died out after
a few months.</p>

<p>Soon after the failure of Buenos Ayres, our own
Australian colony of New South Wales made a
bid for the favour of English beef-eaters. Mr
Mort, an enterprising citizen of Sydney, introduced
Nicolle's freezing process for preserving
fresh meat in an untainted state. He was sanguine
that the same ship might convey beef and mutton
from Australia to England and emigrants from
England to Australia, thereby conferring a double
benefit on the colonies. Queensland and Victoria
were also on the <i>qui vive</i>, ready to find a market
for their surplus live-stock in the old mother-country,
if events presented favourable symptoms.
The freezing process was not by any means the
only one tried in Australia. One was an adaptation
of Appert's plan of putting fresh meat into
tins and drawing out all the air; a second was to
exclude warmth by packing in ice; a third was
to exclude moisture in such way as to pack the
meat in as dry a state as possible. A large trade
was gradually formed by a Sydney Company for
preserving meat for the English market&mdash;not
fresh joints in bulk, but partly cooked in tins.
The oxen and sheep were slaughtered in abattoirs
of improved construction, skinned, boned, and
cut up on large tables; the meat was scalded
by steam in large open trays, put into tins, and
the tins exposed to a temperature of 230Â°&nbsp;F., in a
bath containing chloride of lime dissolved in the
water; then sealed up, exposed to a second bath
somewhat hotter, and finally to a cold bath. Not
only was steamed or parboiled beef and mutton
prepared in this way, but the establishment also
sent out tins of roasted, cured, spiced beef, haricot
of mutton, and so forth. We cannot go into particulars,
and have only to say that the efforts,
however meritorious, have not been a commercial
success.</p>

<p>It may be stated as a well-known fact that the
people of Great Britain will not, as a general rule,
buy inferior kinds of butcher-meat. They are all
glad to purchase at a low price, but the quality
must be good, the look of the meat good, the smell
good. We should confidently say that no people
on the face of the earth are such connoisseurs in
good beef and mutton as the English, down even
to the humblest classes. In point of fact, the
working classes, as they are called, are more fastidious
as regards quality and superior cuts than
persons of distinction. Laying down this as a
rule, it is throwing away trouble and capital to
try to serve the English with anything short of the
best fresh meat, as usually obtained from butchers.
Frozen meat will not do, for it will not keep.
Tinned meat half-cooked, and however well spiced,
is also not the thing. One may regret the prejudices
often entertained on this score. But for the
sake of all parties it is best to acknowledge the
fact.</p>

<p>The only expedient likely to be successful is
that of importing fresh meat from the United
States, owing to the comparatively short duration
of the voyage and the several fleets of fine
steamers belonging to capitalists, who are never
slack in throwing themselves into any trade
that promises to be fairly remunerating. The
proceedings, in brief, are managed as follows.
Live-stock, brought to New York by rail from
the central and western states of America, are
conveyed to well-arranged abattoirs, where they
are quickly slaughtered, skinned, &amp;c. Several
hundred carcases are put at once into a large
cool chamber, where they are kept for a day or
two&mdash;the period depending on the state of the
weather. They are then quartered, wrapped up
in coarse canvas, and conveyed to the steamer,
drawn up alongside a quay or wharf. A compartment
is set aside for the reception of the meat,
with an ice-chamber at one end. A current of
fresh air, filtered through cotton-wool, is driven
over the ice by a steam-worked fan or blast, and
thence over the masses of meat. About forty tons
of ice are shipped for keeping cool the carcases of
a hundred and fifty cattle: reduced probably to a
third or quarter of this amount by melting during
the voyage. According to the quantity of fresh air
forced through the ice-chamber, so is the degree of
temperature produced. After many experiments,
an opinion has been arrived at that a freezing
temperature is neither necessary nor desirable;
four or five degrees above that point are preferred,
the meat arriving in a pure and fresh state at
Liverpool. The quantity shipped at once is sometimes
very large. The <i>Wyoming</i> steamer, for
instance, brought over at one time in the middle
of the recent month of February two thousand
three hundred quarters of beef and the carcases
of four hundred sheep. In one week a million
and a quarter pounds of meat were brought from
New York to Liverpool.</p>

<p>Glasgow, as opening direct by the Clyde to the
Atlantic, with its fleet of steamers and enterprising
traders, bids fair to be a rival to Liverpool in the
American meat-traffic. Every week there are
paragraphs in the newspapers announcing fresh
arrivals. We quote the following as a specimen
from the <i>Scotsman</i> of March 7: 'The extension of
the American meat-trade at all the larger towns in
Scotland has been very marked during the past
month, and the import has been quite unequal to
the demand. The steamers belonging to the
Anchor line of weekly mail packets, which have
been bringing from eight hundred to a thousand
quarters of fresh meat each voyage, have been
compelled to increase their cool-meat cell accommodation
by fully one-half. The State line of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">{254}</a></span>
weekly steamers are also being fitted up with
the necessary apparatus for this traffic, and the
first steamer of that line with fresh meat&mdash;six
hundred quarters&mdash;was reported last night at the
Clyde. The Anchor Line mail-steamer <i>Anchoria</i>
also arrived yesterday. The latter vessel brings
the largest cargo of fresh meat yet imported into
Scotland, having on board one thousand six hundred
quarters beef and two hundred carcases of
sheep. The two consignments (two thousand two
hundred quarters) are nearly equal to any previous
fortnight's supply. About one-half of this quantity
of fresh meat will be sold in Glasgow market,
and the other half will be despatched to Edinburgh,
Newcastle, Dundee, and other large towns. In
Glasgow and Greenock there has been a further
extension of shops for the sale of American fresh
meat. The Glasgow butchers are now pretty
extensive buyers of the imported beef, and they
have again had to lower their prices for home-fed
meat by 1d. per lb., making a total reduction on
roast and steaks of 3d. per lb., and on other sorts
of 2d. per lb. The American meat, however, is
still from 1d. to 2d. per lb. cheaper than the
medium home sorts. During February the American
meat imports at Glasgow, which may be considered
as the landing-place for Scotland, amounted
to the following large aggregates: 4650 quarters
fresh beef, 500 sheep, 2440 tierces salted beef, 1830
barrels salted pork, 1037 barrels hams, 700 barrels
tongues, 9300 boxes bacon, and 20,500 cases of
tinned (preserved) meat. In the previous month
(January) the fresh meat imported aggregated 3728
quarters and 620 sheep; while in December the
quantity was about one-half that of January.
There is nearly as great an advance in the import
of corned meat, bacon, and salted beef and pork.
950 barrels of tallow and 700 barrels of lard were
imported last month. Butter and cheese also form
an important item in the cargoes from New York;
and last month there was an aggregate of 2500
boxes of cheese and 7050 packages of butter
brought in six steamers.'</p>

<p>While Glasgow is the source of supply to various
places in Scotland, Liverpool sends consignments
by railways to London, Birmingham, Manchester,
Sheffield, and other large centres of population.
Some part of the conveyance is managed by aid
of Acklom's patent refrigerating wagons. These
vehicles, constructed and fitted to keep always
cool in the interior, are drawn up to the ship's
side at the docks, laden with meat, horsed through
the streets to a railway depÃ´t, placed upon trucks,
conveyed to any other station, dismounted from
the trucks, and driven to warehouses and storehouses.
If there be continuous rail from the quay
to the final warehouse, so much the better.</p>

<p>What do the butchers and the public think of
this beef and mutton? It is now known that the
meat should be cooked and eaten as soon as possible
after being landed, else it loses somewhat of its
good flavour. The newspapers stated that a consignment
of two hundred quarters of beef to
Edinburgh became deteriorated towards the last,
by remaining too long in shops or stores unprovided
with cooling appliances.</p>

<p>A remarkable enterprise has just been commenced
in London in connection with this subject.
An 'Australian Meat Agency Company' has existed
for several years; it imports canistered provisions
of all kinds from our antipodean colonies; but as
Sydney and Melbourne have not yet surmounted
the difficulties of establishing a profitable transmission
of fresh joints of meat to England, the
Company has laid itself open to the reception of
such meat from any country. Underneath the
vast Cannon Street terminus of the South-eastern
Railway are ranges of brick vaults which the Meat
Company has just taken at an annual rental.
Fresh air from the river is admitted into a
refrigerating chamber, whence, after being cooled
down, it passes into other chambers where the
meat is placed on broad open shelves; a small
steam-engine forces the air over the ice in the
refrigerating chambers, and thence into the several
meat chambers. A sloping road leads up from the
vaulted chambers to the railway level, and there
are four landing-stages from the river&mdash;thus affording
considerable facilities for the arrival and
departure of large consignments of meat. The
expectation is that the meat will keep cool and
good for several days, instead of being forced
occasionally on an unwilling market to avert spoiling;
and if this expectation be realised, the same
plan may be adopted for poultry, fruit, and dairy
produce.</p>

<p>The retailing at present is a puzzle. We are
told from time to time that the butchers cry down
the American meat in order to keep up the high
price of English and Scotch beef and mutton; that
they sometimes sell slightly tainted English meat
under the name of American, to bring down the
fair fame of the latter; and that more frequently
they buy the foreign meat and sell it again as
English. The butchers deny these allegations,
and the public are left to find out the truth
for themselves the best way they can. At the
Cold Stores, as they are called, of the Meat
Agency Company, above described, the price for
sides, quarters, and large joints varies from about
sixpence-halfpenny to ninepence per pound&mdash;small
joints being higher per pound than large,
and meat for roasting higher than meat for
boiling. The demand for the latter being much
less than that for the former, a rapid sale for the
whole is found to be difficult, unless buyers are
tempted by a lower price for round, brisket, and
other boiling-pieces. As a small joint of the best
roasting beef is tenpence per pound, the reduction
below the price for English beef is certainly not
considerable, especially as the sellers do not send
the meat to the consumers' houses. If the trade
establishes itself on a firm footing, there will probably
be retail stores in various parts of London
(and other large towns) for the sale of American
meat; or else the regular butchers will sell
American as well as English meat, each at its own
proper price. One thing is certain, as already
hinted, that unless the Americans send first-rate
qualities of meat, they need not send it at all.
Another thing they must attend to is, that in
cutting up the meat it must be neatly <i>dressed</i>. On
this score we have heard serious complaints. The
quarters of beef are too often not properly trimmed
for market, at least not sufficiently so to please
English wholesale dealers.</p>

<p>Other nations are striving to ascertain whether
they can obtain a share in this new meat-trade. A
French Company has built a ship called <i>La Frigorifique</i>,
to ply between Buenos Ayres and Brest;
it contains cool chambers which will keep meat at
any desired temperature. The process adopted is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">{255}</a></span>
that of M. Tellier. Methylic ether, like ammonia,
evaporates rapidly, and absorbs heat from neighbouring
bodies in so doing; the vapour passing
through tubes in a cylinder cools down the air outside
the tubes; the cooled air passes into chambers
in the hold, where the meat is either hung up or
put on shelves. The methylic ether can be used
over and over again with only little waste. The
hope of the Company is to be able to stow in the
ship the meat of a thousand head of cattle, bring it
from Buenos Ayres to Brest in a little over a
month, and sell it at about two-thirds the price
of French meat. At the time we are writing, the
<i>Frigorifique</i> is making her first voyage; on the
principle that 'the proof of the pudding is in the
eating,' we must wait awhile to learn the result.</p>

<p>Some of the Liverpool steamers are, it is reported,
being fitted up with refrigerating apparatus for
bringing freshly killed meat from Spain. The continental
railways are organising a plan to bring
meat from Hungary in three days in refrigerating
cars, at a freight-charge of a little over a halfpenny
per pound, to Ostend or some port whence it could
be shipped to England. Moscow is said to be able
to buy fairly good beef at fourpence per pound, and
is calculating whether London could obtain some
of it at about sevenpence.</p>

<p>The new move certainly has some lively elements
in it, and we shall watch with some interest
its development. As yet, the introduction of
huge cargoes of fresh meat has had no sensible
effect in lowering the standard market prices. To
some extent this may be explained by the suspended
importation of live oxen from the continent,
on account of the dreaded cattle disease.
Unless, however, the importation of fresh meat
from America or elsewhere attains a very gigantic
scale, we do not anticipate any very marked reduction
of prices. From the increasing wealth and
population in the British Islands, the demand for
meat will long far outrun the means of native
supply. The agricultural interest may as yet
keep itself tolerably at ease on the subject.</p></div>

<h2><a name="MOUNT_PISGAH_LONDON_W" id="MOUNT_PISGAH_LONDON_W">MOUNT PISGAH, LONDON, W.</a></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is not much of a mountain, scarcely deserving
the name of a hill in fact, but the name will indicate
aptly enough the character of the inhabitants;
for it is here that many look longingly into the
social Promised Land which they cannot enter.
Mount Pisgah is the region of struggling gentility;
as Saffron Hill is of organ-grinders; as Brixton
is of merchants; as Westburnia is of Hebrews and
Anglo-Asiatics; as Brook Street is of doctors, and
Islington of City clerks. From the centre and axis
of the <i>haut ton</i>, which ends at Park Lane, respectability
radiates in a north-westerly and south-westerly
direction; but whereas South Kensington
abruptly terminates in Brompton, the region of
Hyde Park, properly so called, merges into Bayswater
and Westburnia, the outer circle ending in
Mount Pisgah. There is a general air of neglect
about the neighbourhood, and although the houses
are rather pretentious-looking buildings, they are
rarely troubled with the hands of the painter or
plasterer. Corinthian columns and stuccoed balustrades
lose much of their effect when chipped and
scribbled over and used as the vehicle for the
artistic displays of youth&mdash;in chalks. The doorsteps
are not always very clean; and in the street,
if it is not dusty, it is muddy; and if scraps of
paper are not flying about, orange-peel and broken
crockery strew your path. But then this is also a
great place for the 'slut of a servant,' who is cheap
if nothing else; and for the streets, well, the vestry
are not likely to be troubled with complaints from
such birds of passage as the Pisgans all are&mdash;or all
hope to be, I should say&mdash;for too often, alas, do
they find their wings clipped and their stay involuntary.
In Mount Pisgah, majors and colonels
are as plentiful as blackberries; high-wranglers
and ex-Indian judges jostle first classmen and 'late
political residents.' Unbeneficed clergymen, who
eagerly scan the <i>Times</i> advertisements each morning
for pupils; unsuccessful doctors and disappointed
barristers waiting for the patients and the
briefs that are so long in coming; and others who
are seeking to eke out a scanty income by that
very poor crutch but passable walking-stick, as
some one has aptly called literature&mdash;all these
abound in this neighbourhood. The only prosperous
people are the butchers and bakers and other
trades-people. They nod familiarly their 'Good
morning, Gineral,' or 'Wet day, Mister,' to the
humble officer or tutor who shovels past with
the weight of the remembrance of those rapidly
increasing bills for inferior joints and alumed
bread, which he must meet at the end of the
quarter.</p>

<p>The commercial ethics of Mount Pisgah are not
altogether peculiar to themselves; but if one rule
meets with greater observance than another, it is,
that as bills increase quality shall decrease; and
after all, as Mr Undercut or Mr Crumpet will
tell you, they are often 'took in dreadful.' How
eagerly pay-day is looked forward to! the brief
interval from the depressing pecuniary cares of
their lives that comes to each four times a year.
A 'social' then takes place. Ordinarily, old Mangosteen,
of the &mdash;th Native Infantry, meeting
Junglebird, C.S.I., who lived with him in the
N.W.P., where they were as brothers, says 'How
do?' and passes on. Each knows that the other
has but one thought&mdash;his embarrassments: they
respect one another's misfortunes, and avoid the
hollow mockeries to which conversation must
necessarily give rise. But towards the end of
each quarter all this is changed; there is going
to be a little dinner; or 'My womenkind are turning
the house inside out for a dance;' or 'The boys
are going to row us down to Richmond;' and then
Junglebird and Mangosteen kill their tigers over
again, and chuckle merrily over that roaring night
at the &mdash;th mess; and Briefless and Exminus
recall the old Combination Room jokes; and if,
as they sip their cheap claret, they think with
some regret of that mellow ruby nectar that
the cellars of St Botolph's used sometimes to
produce; they also remember how, when up last
autumn for the election of a 'Silverpoker' (as
the Esquire Bedel is irreverently called, from his
emblem of office), they had found two fellows of
their own time martyrs to gout and a nuisance to
the whole college&mdash;for which that delicious 'old
tawny' was doubtless responsible. The ladies in
Mount Pisgah take quite a different tone too, at
this eventful period. Although at other times not
quite so 'solitary' in their habits as their husbands&mdash;for
women find a comfort in talking over their
common troubles&mdash;they have long discussions
upon the chance of Charley getting a presentation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">{256}</a></span>
to Christ's Hospital; or of Tommy's cadetship at
Wellington; or how Mr Howling Hawley, the great
singing-master, held out hopes of dear Amelia's
voice being a fortune to her; and yet how dreadful
it would be for the poor child to appear
before the public; but then you know, my dear,
things have altered so much since our time, and
now you really find quite respectable people performing
in public! But when they give their
little dinners and dances and the rest, you shall
see how the Pisgan ladies will rise to the occasion,
and you shall not find in Grosvenor Square
a more strict observance of the rules of etiquette.
And if at times it is a little old-fashioned and
somewhat more strict than Society demands in
these loose times, it bears the right stamp, and
might indeed be profitably imitated in many more
pretentious houses.</p>

<p>Of course it is a long time since those Pisgans
who have belonged to the Rag or the Oriental, or
the Union or Junior, have ceased to be members
of those institutions. Some have found that the
seven or eight guineas required at the most critical
period of the year could be spent to much better
purpose; others have felt that the old associations
would be too painful. But they have their clubs
nevertheless. Within the last ten years clubs have
become as plentiful as hotels nearly. And the
enterprising City gentleman who fits up a big house
with a dining and reading and smoking and morning
and billiard room, and advertises the inauguration
of the Pantheon Club, 'for the benefit of
those gentlemen who are unable to enter the older
clubs owing to their overcrowded condition,'
requires names for his committee. Military Pisgans
are admirably suited for this rÃ´le. What a blessing
too, that they have such a place to go to,
instead of always pottering about at home, where
they would be but too often in the way.</p>

<p>There are more troublesome things than canaries
and poodles, novel-reading and invitation cards, to
be attended to by the mammas and daughters of
Pisgan households. Committees of ways and means;
arguing with the cook who 'hasn't been accustomed'
to some obviously wise little economy; softening
the anger of some brow-beating creditor; twisting
and turning, and 'managing,' to make old appear
like new, are all matters in which the presence of
a male creature is worse than useless. So there is
a vague sort of tradition that papa goes to his club
to write letters, and to be there if anything should
turn up. And he sometimes writes a few letters,
and reads all the papers, and smokes a good many
pipes, and takes a sandwich and moderate tankard
of beer for his lunch, and saunters down Regent
Street, or drops into the British Museum Reading-room
or the National Gallery&mdash;or into the India or
Colonial Office, to see if 'anything is turning up.'
Besides, he will give you the particulars of a review
in Hyde Park, or a boat-race on the Thames, or a
'demonstration' at the 'Reformers' Tree,' just as
well as the evening papers, for these are all luxuries
within his reach. And in the season you will see
him on the wrong side of the Row looking into the
Promised Land. Time was perhaps when he too
had joined a knot of laughing youths at the Corner,
or seated on horseback had tapped his lackered
boot with infinite self-satisfaction, or trotted along
at the side of some fair creature with whom he
would dance an unconscionable number of dances
that same evening. He was a sub or an undergraduate
at the time, and saw Fortune within his
grasp; but he missed his chance, or Fortune was
unkind; and gall and vinegar were his portion
instead of milk and honey.</p>

<p>Some of the inhabitants of Mount Pisgah are
fairly off, and merely live there because they find
the place cheap and they are not forced into any
fashionable extravagances. But this is not the
case with most. Their pleasures are negative&mdash;the
mere temporary absence of care. The continually
recurring question, 'How shall I pay?' or
'What will it cost?' crushes every sense of comfort
and ease out of them. For them is none of the
happy regularity of well-to-do respectability&mdash;the
wiping off of unpaid bills as regularly as Mary
Jane the housemaid dusts the escritoire with its
dainty pieces of Japan-work and ormolu. Not for
them the pleasant little morning duties; the list
for Mudie's; the tending of the conservatory; the
new waltz by Godfrey; the orders for tradesmen
and for dinner (the one crumpled rose-leaf perhaps,
this); the afternoon shopping or visiting; the
drive to Pall Mall, or the Temple, or the City, to
bring papa back from his club, or his chambers,
or his office; the pretty frequent theatre and
concert; the weekly 'at-homes;' the friendly
dances, and more elaborate balls, that are of constant
occurrence when town is full. Life is very
hard and ugly in Mount Pisgah. Captain Burton
the great traveller, says in one of his late works
that he wonders how any poor man can ever think
of living in England, or any rich one out of it.
If England, perhaps more so London; and it is
only necessary to know a little of Mount Pisgah
to learn what a fascination is exercised over some
men's minds by this dear foggy, hard and tender,
rich and squalid, centre of an Englishman's world,
yclept London.</p></div>
